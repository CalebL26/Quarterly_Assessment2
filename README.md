# Quarterly_Assessment2
datainsertion.py: All of the quiz's questions/answers go here.

createfile.py: Sets the names of the tables in the database, which are all of my currently enrolled classes. 


readFile.py: Pulls the names of the tables in the database and also retrieves all of the data in the tables.

appFile.py: Runs the code, starting the quiz bowl. It allows user to choose category (1-5) of questions before answering. Also displays text in red/green if the answer is correct or incorrect. 

quiz_bowl.db: Stores all of our data and values(2) within those tables

createTable.py: Had issues actually creating tables so made seeperate python file to create table with sql script

Side note: I know you said, Professor Clary, that you would like us to commit and stage more often but I just lost track of time when coding this out and got frustrated because this was my fourth repository I created because I couldn't debug my other ones. So I did not stage and commit as much and I can't now go back and do it.
